## **Mission**

To create the _simplest_, _most trustworthy_, and _actually usable_ personal finance tool available; one that ex-Mint users will instantly love, and that data privacy nuts will rave over.

## üß™ MVP Goals

The first working version will:

- Let users securely log in with passkeys & TOTP
- Pull in bank transactions via Plaid
- Encrypt all financial data client-side before storage
- Allow setting monthly budgets + category rollovers
- Auto-categorize transactions + allow user overrides
- Visualize budgets with red/yellow/green progress bars
- Support local AI planning: ‚ÄúCan I afford this trip?‚Äù
- Launch as freemium (with account/category limits)

---

## üîí Core Principles

- **Privacy-first**: All sensitive data encrypted _before_ it hits our DB
- **Trust by design**: No ads, upsells, or selling data‚Äîever
- **No BS simplicity**: At-a-glance clarity, no fiddly workflows
- **Local AI**: Real planning help powered by on-device models
