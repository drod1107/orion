# Release Notes

## v0.1.0 – Upcoming (MVP Beta)

* **Initial Beta Release:** This version represents the MVP feature set for Orion.
* **Authentication:** Implemented Clerk-based login with passkeys (WebAuthn) and optional TOTP 2FA for enhanced account security.
* **Bank Sync:** Added integration with Plaid to connect bank accounts and automatically import transactions daily.
* **Budgeting:** Users can create budget categories with monthly limits (including category roll-overs to the next month).
* **Transaction Categorization:** Transactions are auto-categorized on import. Users can review incoming transactions in a dedicated inbox, adjust categories, and define rules for future transactions.
* **Budget Dashboard:** Introduced a dashboard view with color-coded progress bars (green/yellow/red) to show spending against each budget category at a glance.
* **AI Assistant:** Included a local AI feature that answers questions like “Can I afford X?” using the user’s data (runs in-browser for privacy).
* **Freemium Model:** Launching with a free tier (limited number of linked accounts and budget categories) and a premium tier (unlimited accounts/categories and future premium features) for sustainable monetization.
* **Miscellaneous:** Set up analytics with PostHog (self-hosted) for user interaction insights, and integrated Stripe for handling premium subscription payments (will activate once premium features launch).

*(Further details and any bug fixes will be documented here as development continues. Future releases will be appended in descending order.)*
